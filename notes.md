Sometimes you need save some data, like text or pictures. With notes you can save any types of Telegram's data


## Available commands are:
- `/save (name) (data)`: Replying to a message will save that message. Even works on media!
- `/get (name)`: get the note registered to that word.
- `/clear (name)`: deletes the note
- `/notes` or `/saved`: Lists all notes
- `/noteinfo (name)`: Shows detailed info about note, who updated and created note
{.grid-list}

## Example

An example of how to save a note would be via:
`/save data This is example note!`

Now, anyone using `/get data`, or `#data` will be replied to with `This is example note!`.

## Saving pictures and other non-text data

If you want to save an image, gif, or sticker, or any other data, do the following:
`/save word` while replying to a sticker or whatever data you'd like. Now, the note at `#word` contains a sticker which will be sent as a reply.

## Retriving notes without the formatting
To retrieve a note without the formatting, use `/get (name) noformat`
This will retrieve the note and send it without formatting it; getting you the raw note, allowing you to make easy edits.
